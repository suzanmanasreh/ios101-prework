## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite Apps:

* Tiktok
   * Learns video preferences
   * Clean design
* Apple Fitness
   * Has fitness challenges
   * Automatically creates activity goals 
* Apple Notes
    * Simple, clean, uncluttered design
    * Easy to share notes with friends
    * Can scan docs

App Idea:

One app idea is to create a crowdsourced textbook answers website or app that allows people to select a textbook and upload hand-written solutions. Slader used to have this, but then it got bought by Quizlet, and they made the repository of textbook answers paid. There are alternatives like ChatGPT, but I'd prefer not to rely on LLM's all the time.

## Notes

No challenged encountered. Swift is very straightforward, and I look forward to working with it.
